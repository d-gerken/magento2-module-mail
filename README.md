# Magento 2 enhanced mailing module

This module enhances the magento 2 capabilities to send transactional mails.
In a plain magento 2 installation it is neither possible to track and manage 
transactional emails sent by magento 2 system, nor it is possible to store 
mails locally or at backup service providers.

This mailing module distinguishes between parts of email processing:

- A mail transport system which takes care of transport of outgoing mails 
  to a mail service provider and retrieval of returning meta data for 
  mails entities.
  
- A mail storeage systen which takes care of storing the data of outgoing
  mails and its metadata on file-systems.
